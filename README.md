## Government spending on kids
This dataset provides a comprehensive accounting of public spending on children from 1997 through 2016. It draws on the US Census Bureauâ€™s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, as well as several federal and other noncensus sources, to capture state-by-state spending on education, income security, health, and other areas.
